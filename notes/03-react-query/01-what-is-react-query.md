# React Query

**Section overview : **

- **Remote State** Management
- **React Query** will take over data fetching and storage

## What is React Query

- Powerful library for managing remote (server) state
- Many features that allow us to write a lot less code, while also making the UX a lot better:
  - Data is stored in a cache
  - Automatic loading and error states
  - Automatic re-fetching to keep state synched
  - Pre-fetching
  - Easy remote state mutation (updating)
  - Offline support
- Needed because remote state is fundamentally different from regular UI state
